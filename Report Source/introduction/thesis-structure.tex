\section{Thesis structure}
There are five chapters in this capstone project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter 1 briefly describes the project about problem’s motivation, as well as the project’s objectives and scope
    \item Chapter 2 is dedicated to presenting the foundational knowledge about convex optimization, mixed-integer optimization, and graph theory that are essential for understanding the proposed method.
    \item Chapter 3 arranges the discussion of related works on the same task to deepen the understanding of existing methods and their constraints.  
    \item Chapter 4 describes the GCS framework and the formulation of our MICP. From that, we present the experimental results and analysis of our method in various environments with different complexity levels.
    \item Chapter 5 summarizes whole project and the plan for future development.
\end{itemize}
